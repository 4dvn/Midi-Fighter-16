## The Arduino sketch is provided by Gustavo Silveira

* Watch his youtube channel for a lot of info about making MIDI controllers with the Arduino.

## Change the Sketch as you need. Be aware of Digital Pin 13, it can make some really funky unwanted triggering. It has been disabled in the sketch.

## This should be very easy to make, so I have not provided the diagram for it since this is really basic knowledge wiring it up and maybe you dont want to use the same Digital Pins as I do. The Mega has more than enough analog and digital pints for this controller.
