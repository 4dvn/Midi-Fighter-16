## What hardware you need to make one:

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* On/off switch size 12.9mmx19.4mm ( Program mode )
* 16 Sanwa 24mm Arcade buttons (or clones)
* 4 Knobs size: 15mm x 17mm (KN-11/WS) 
* 4 10k potentiometers 
* 8 4-6mm M3 button head screws
* Arduino Uno (mounting screws or glue gun)
* Dupont wires for the arduino
* Wires for the buttons and potentiometers

## Installing 

For the software use the MocoLufa boot loader and you are able to program the Arduino again without needing to flash the boot loader. This is what the ON/OFF switch is for. READ THE MocoLUFA instructions on the link. And as a bonus the Arduino shows up and work as a normal Native USB MIDI device without the need for a emulator such as hairless MIDI etc:
